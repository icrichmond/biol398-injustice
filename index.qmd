## What is Environmental Inequity/Injustice?

## Environmental Harm

::: notes
Environmental inequity and racism has existed in Canada for as long as settler colonialism has. - We can (and should) think of the colonization of Canada as the first act of environmental racism (among many other things).

Origins of the environmental justice framework
:::

## The Environmental Justice Framework

-   starts with the presence of adverse health outcomes from pollution
    -   cancer in Halifax
    -   air pollution in LA (Bullard)
-   has expanded to include other aspects of health and wellbeing
    -   tree canopy
    -   access to green space
    -   

## Settler Colonialism

## Environmental Racism

## Environmental Classism

## Systems

-   These things are not separate - deeply intertwined
-   

## Ecology's Role

-   gentrification

## Ecological Examples

-   Frederic Back
-   New UdeM campus

## Conservation's Role

-   Land dispossession
-   Palestine

## Conservation Examples

-   reclaiming foraging?

## Injustice by Design

-   the injustice we experience in all aspects of life is an intentional and unintentional outcome of our society's structure and priorities

## Cities by Design

## Attempts at Environmental Justice

## Discussion 

4\. Find a different piece of paper, uncrumple, and respond to what is written

5\. Re-crumple and throw your paper across the room

6\. Pick up any piece of paper

7\. Discuss in groups of your choosing what is on the paper

-   **NOTE: write your names on a paper and hand it in for participation marks**

## Discussion (continued)

If we have lots of time, here are the next steps to the activity:

8\. When you have finished discussing the papers your group has, each group send one person to a new group to present the discussion you just had to a new group

9\. The new group adds/discusses/agrees/disagrees with the presented discussion
