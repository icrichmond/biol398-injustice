## What is Environmental Inequity/Injustice?


Marginalized groups within our population *systematically* experience higher levels of environmental risk, and enjoy worse/limited access to quality nature and the environment than their counterparts.

- experienced along lines of race and class through settler-colonialist violence, anti-Black racism, classism, etc.
- access to a healthy environment is a [**human right**](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/10/1102582)

> "... without a doubt, racism influences the likelihood of exposure to environmental and health risks and the accessibility to health care.

> Racism provides whites of all class levels with an "edge" in gaining access to a healthy physical environment." - [Robert D. Bullard, 1993](https://cafethorium.whoi.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/33/2021/02/Anatomy-of-Environmental-Racism-and-the-Environmental-Justice-Movement.pdf)

Canada's environment was taken from Indigenous peoples who managed the land since time immemorial.

::: notes
Environmental inequity and racism has existed in Canada for as long as settler colonialism has. 
- We can (and should) think of the colonization of Canada as the first act of environmental racism (among many other things).

## Injustice by Design

-   Urban planning is defined as a social endeavor that has a distinct set of goals designed to reach an “optimal strategy” determined by those in power ([Alexander, 1992](https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&lr=&id=tyPIG4lL3QoC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=Urban+planning+is+defined+as+a+social+endeavor+that+has+a+distinct+set+of+goals+designed+to+reach+an+%E2%80%9Coptimal+strategy%E2%80%9D+determined+by+those+in+power&ots=4geEVvcQjw&sig=9X1zM7UX77wN0z-fCrl1EIW6LN0&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false))

-   Urban planning reflects the priorities and beliefs of our settler-colonial, racist, classist, patriarchal societies back onto us

## Ecology's Role

-   access to nature 
-   gentrification

## Ecological Examples

-   Frederic Back
-   New UdeM campus

## Conservation's Role

-   Land dispossession
-   Palestine

## Conservation Examples

-   reclaiming foraging?

Origins of the environmental justice framework
:::


::: notes
-   starts with the presence of adverse health outcomes from pollution
    -   cancer in Halifax
    -   air pollution in LA (Bullard)
-   has expanded to include other aspects of health and wellbeing
    -   tree canopy
    -   access to green space

## Environmental Justice Framework 

1. Incorporates principle right of all people to be protected from environmental degradation

2. Adopts a public health model of prevention

3. Shifts burden of proof to actors who do harm and/or do not protect marginalized groups

4. Uses impact instead of intent to infer discrimination

5. Uses targeted actions and resources

[Bullard, 2008](https://uwosh.edu/sirt/wp-content/uploads/sites/86/2017/08/Bullard_Environmental-Justice-in-the-21st-Century.pdf)



## Environmental Justice in Action




## Discussion

SNOWBALL ACTIVITY

1\. Take out a sheet of paper (I have some if you don't)

2\. Write a response to any of these discussion points:

-   D1

-   D2

-   D3

3\. Crumple and throw your paper across the room

## Discussion

4\. Find a different piece of paper, uncrumple, and respond to what is written

5\. Re-crumple and throw your paper across the room

6\. Pick up any piece of paper

7\. Discuss in groups of your choosing what is on the paper

-   **NOTE: write your names on a paper and hand it in for participation marks**

## Discussion (continued)

If we have lots of time, here are the next steps to the activity:

8\. When you have finished discussing the papers your group has, each group send one person to a new group to present the discussion you just had to a new group

9\. The new group adds/discusses/agrees/disagrees with the presented discussion

10\. Repeat with a different group member
