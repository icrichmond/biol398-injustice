Now, as we mentioned, the right of all people to be protected from environmental degradation has become somewhat mainstream with the UN declaring a human right to a healthy environment 2. The public health model of prevention instead of reaction is really key here, and something that goes overlooked or ignored many times. In Canada, we see this with mining companies a lot. Due to the Canadian government’s lax regulations, mining companies break rules, degrade the environment and pollute Indigenous lands, declare bankruptcy and move on leaving legacies of injustice in Indigenous communities and are nowhere to clean up the mess, let alone prevent it 3. Shifts burden of proof to actors who do harm. We saw the NECAG law case, where they lost because they had the burden of proof upon them to prove that this was going to harm their children, their seniors, themselves. It is critical that the burden of proof is not on marginalized communities, that those in development of any kind must themselves prove that it is not harmful, unjust, inequitable. 4. This again, has become more mainstream since 2008. It does not matter if your intent was not to enact environmental injustice, if the impact is that it did – that is the problem. 5. Target resources where people need them the most, and moving away from objective science to include human values and priorities."

    "text": "Injustice by Design\n\n\nUrban planning is defined as a social endeavor that has a distinct set of goals designed to reach an “optimal strategy” determined by those in power (Alexander, 1992)\n\n\n\nIn our society, the inequity and injustice we face is by design, it is intentional. That does not mean, that individual actors are responsible for the existence of racism, but it does mean that this is not a natural phenomenon. For example, whiteness is a construct that was invented for a specific purpose, the subjugation of non-white people. And of course, even though it is made up it is also very real.\nWe also know that our design reflects our society. So when we build cities, highly designed and managed cities, they reflect the injustices of our society back onto us if we do not actively work to disrupt that. Again, these are systems and so they will run without our input. We need to make active effort if we want them to do anything else.\nBecause urban planning is done by those in power, and the goals of urban planning are most often determined by those in power, it reflects the injustice of our society.\nWe see this in so many ways in cities, one of those ways is tree canopy cover and urban heat. We see this here in Montreal, in so many neighbourhoods but this example is extremely stark.\nOther examples?"
